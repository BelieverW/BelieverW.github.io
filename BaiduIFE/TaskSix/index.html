                        Haruki Kitahara's light music club is on the verge of disbanding.
                        At this rate, the third year's dream of performing at the school festival would never be
                        realized. However, as his exhausted fingers drift through the chords of "White Album",
                        the first song he would ever play, an angelic voice and mysterious piano begin harmonizing
                        with his lonely guitar. It is a momentous performance that marks the beginning of
                        everything for Haruki.

                            All of this is from memory. I don’t think my memory is the best. So there’s bound to be
                            some inaccuracies, perhaps more temporal than factual. I cut out the existence of numerous
                            side characters within Concluding Chapter. They are affable, but not essential to the main
                            storyline. <img src="img/2.jpeg" alt="wa2">There may be discrete entries written about each particular heroine, but try not
                            to count on it.

                            Flip a page to see the next segment. There are embedded pictures, so I didn’t want to spoil
                            out of each respective section. I suggest reading it chronologically.

                            If you’re a Setsuna fan, do not skip the Touma routes. If you’re a Touma fan, do not skip
                            the Setsuna routes. I’ve written this so no information repeats. So, if you skip a section,
                            you’ll skip too much.

                            A summary, regardless of how detailed, cannot replace actually reading through the story.
                            I highly recommend actually reading the work. But for some, that’s not a practical choice.
                            So for those who cannot be bothered, this entry exists. This isn’t an entirely objective
                            summary. It includes much sentimentality, and preferences to specific characters. But I
                            include, and try my best to define each character as they are. The feeling that you get when reading this should be akin to listening to an orator telling a story, than of reading historical text. It might not be for everyone. In the end, do note that no matter how holistic, or detailed a summary may be, it will invariably fail in properly conveying the sentiments of the work.
